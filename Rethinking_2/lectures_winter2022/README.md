# Statistical Rethinking Winter 2022 lectures with Python and PyMC

[Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is an incredible introductory book to Bayesian Statistics. It follows a [_Jaynesian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) and practical approach with very good examples and clear explanations.

In this directory, we create the lecture code that are *not* in the book. It appears that Dr. McElreath used these updated lectures as draft material for a third edition of the book. The lectures are in video form [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN). The notebooks refer to slide numbers from the individual lectures [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rmcelreath/). For lecture code that are exact replicates of book code, please refer to the main directory.
