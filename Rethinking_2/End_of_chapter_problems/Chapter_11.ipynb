    "\n",
    "After exponentiating the coefficient, this value represents the factor to multiply by the odds by when a 1 unit increase in the predictor variable occurs. In this problem, a coefficient of 1.7 means that the proportional odds with a 1 unit change leads to multiplying the odds by $\\text{exp}(1.7) \\approx 5.474$. It is important to emphasize that this is relative number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardizing the feature (if continuous) facilitiates interpretation; a 1 unit change in this case means 1 standard deviation change. If the variable is categorical and dummy-encoded, then 1 unit change represents the shift from the class assigned 0 to the class assigned 1."

One car might tabulate the number of cars every mile, while the other might keep track every kilometer. The use of an offset would be applicable in this case as well."
