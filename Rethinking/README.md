# Statistical Rethinking with Python and PyMC3

[Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is an incredible good introductory book to Bayesian Statistics, its follows a _Jaynesian_ and practical approach with very good examples and clear explanations.

In this repository we ported the codes ([originally in R and Stan](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking)) in the book to PyMC3. We are trying to keep the examples as close as possible to those in the book, while at the same time trying to express them in the most _Pythonic_ and _PyMC3onic_ way we can.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

Feel free to send PR to fix errors, improve the code or made comments that could help the user of this repository and readers of the book.

## Installing the dependencies

To install the dependencies to run these notebooks, you can use
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once you have installed
Anaconda, run:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

to install all the dependencies into an isolated environment. You can switch to
this environment by running:

    source activate pymc3
    
To use the notebooks you first have to register your new environment as a valid notebook kernel:

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name pymc3 --display-name "Python 3.9 (pymc3)"

You can start a notebook by running:
    
    jupyter notebook

or use the more modern jupyter lab:
    
    jupyter lab
    
from the root directory.
