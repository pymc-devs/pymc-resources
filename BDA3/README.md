# Bayesian Data Analysis with Python and PyMC

[Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin is a comprehensive, standard, and wonderful textbook on Bayesian Methods.  There currently exist code for examples in the book in [R](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_R_demos), [Python](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_py_demos), and [Matlab](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_m_demos), all using the [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) language.

This repository is a work in progress, organizing work on porting examples and exercises to Python and PyMC. Please open a pull request on the README to indicate interest in a chapter or section!
