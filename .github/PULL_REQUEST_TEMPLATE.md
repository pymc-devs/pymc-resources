# Thank you for opening a pull request!

Please check our [style guide](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/wiki/PyMC's-Jupyter-Notebook-Style), and also make sure that the notebooks you've modified pass the `pre-commit` checks. If, for example, you modified `notebook1.ipynb` and `notebook2.ipynb`, you could do this by running:

```bash
pre-commit run --files notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
```

You may need to run it a couple of times before all the checks pass.
